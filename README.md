## About Golf Factors

Golf Factors is an advanced analytics tool for predicting tournament winners by matching golfer statistics with course profiles.

### How It Works

Our system analyzes key performance metrics:
- Driving accuracy
- Approach play
- Putting consistency
- Scrambling ability

These metrics are weighted based on the specific demands of each course.

### Fit Score Calculation
- **65%** - Course-specific stats (varies by venue)
- **25%** - Recent Top 10 finishes
- **10%** - Consecutive cuts made

This balance ensures we identify golfers who both fit the course and are playing well right now.

## Features

- Select from various PGA Tour events including:
  - **Majors**: Masters, U.S. Open, PGA Championship, The Open Championship
  - **Signature Events**: Players Championship, Arnold Palmer Invitational, and more
  - **Fall & Spring/Summer Events**: Various PGA Tour stops

- View predicted winners based on statistical analysis
- See weekly results and prediction accuracy
